-- Look over your dataset --
1) The first thing tha comes to mind: there is a lot of different attributes which probably add togethor to get the
column "charges". The ultimate aim would be to narrow down the relationship between "age", "sex", "smoker", etc., in
order to establish how different metrics contribute to charges.
2) The data seems clean: no astounding or obviously incorrect values.
3) Data is organised into columns representing attributes and rows representing a person.


-- Scoping your project --
1) The ultimate aim is simple: establish a formula for charge based on the other attributes given.
2) A secondary (lower) aim is to qualitatively establish trends, such as: does being male increase your charge?
What about a smoker? (The answers for most will probably be fairly intuitive but there will be value in confirming.)
3) Another thing that could be fun to analyse is just how many people fit into the various buckets.

How will the above be accomplished?
- My first thought would be to people that are similer in every metric except one, and then see what impact the
changed metric has on the charge. 
- This will allow us to slowly reduce the degrees of freedom and answer the following formula:

Charges = (U * age) + (V * sex) + (W * children) + (X * smoker) + (Z * region)

Where age, bmi, children are probably values; whereas region and sex are likely represented by some value to account for
the fact they're qualitative values.
